I make misakes, alot of stuf.

Yesterday, I gone to a party with my friend David. He study english with me at university. He wanted to be introduced to Lucy wo he fancied. David and I satt in the corner of the room. He didn ' t making the first move to go and see her. He waited for so long to tell her that he had a crush on her. He taked a drink to get some energy and after a few minutes of endless hesitation, he walked to her. David remained mute. She gave a hint of a smile, noticing David blushing. She asked him if he enjoyed the party. He whispered ' Yes ' and had a glance at me. I wincked at him. That was it. Feeling reassured and confident, he told her which feelings he was experiencing. She suddenly sullened. She looked embarased. She could hardly say a word but after a little seconds, she said : ' I ' m sorry to deceive you but actually I fancy Sebastian ' . David fainted : ' a friend in need is a friend inded ' ! 

I started my schooling as the majority did in my area, at the local primarry school. I then went to the local secondarry school and recieved grades in English, Maths, Phisics,
Biology, Geography, Art, Graphical Comunication and Philosophy of Religeon. I'll not
bore you with the 'A' levels and above. Notice the ambigous English qualification above. It was, in truth, a cource dedicated to reading "Lord of the flies" and other gems, and a weak atempt at getting us to commprehend them. Luckilly my middle-class upbringing gave me a head start as I was already aquainted with that sort of langauge these books used (and not just the Peter and Jane books) and had read simillar books before. I will never be able to put that paticular course down as much as I desire to because, for all its faults, it introduced me to Steinbeck, Malkovich and the wonders of Lenny, mice and pockets. My education never included one iota of grammar. Lynn Truss points out in "Eats, shoots and leaves" that many people were excused from the rigours of learning English grammar during their schooling over the last 30 or so years because the majority or decision-makers decided one day that it might hinder imagination and expresion (so what, I ask, happened to all those expresive and imaginative people before the ruling?).
