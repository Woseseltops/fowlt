New York is amazing. We arrived after traveling for 28 hours, so needed a good rest before going out to explore this amazing city. We went to Coney Island and Chinatown the first day. The next day, Jillian and I walked from her neighborhood in Brooklyn all the way across the Brooklyn Bridge. From the middle of the bridge, I spotted this beautiful old schooner and just had to go check it out. So when we got to the Manhattan side, we walked down to South Street Seaport to Pier 17 to have a look. As we were admiring the boat, the people aboard asked us if were looking for work. At first we said no, but after a nice conversation and a second thought, I asked more about it. And after one test run, I got accepted as crew on Clipper 'City'! She's a 160ft schooner that sails charters up and down to the Statue of Liberty. So I've got a job now, which is really awesome because after not sailing for a few weeks, my eyes were already turning to the water and the horizon again. This way I can make some money and be on the water at the same time. It's really hard work, hoisting all the huge sails six times a day without winches, but it's a great workout. We are also very busy with the documentary Jillian is making about my journey. And of course my birthday! Almost forgot to tell about that. Thanks for all the birthday wishes, it's been amazing! I had a great birthday sailing on another beautiful classical schooner called 'Shearwater' on the Hudson River and past the Statue of Liberty. After that we had some friends come over and I made real dutch pancakes, the good ones with cheese and bacon. Then we rented Big, a movie by Penny Marshall about a little kid who wishes to be big, and then it comes true. It still feels unreal to be 17! So yeah, long story short, I'm having a great time in this enormous, busy, and interesting city!

I'm still enjoying New York a lot. I don't think I could ever live in a big city like this, but for a visit it's a pretty amazing place. I've started to get to know my way around a little bit more, especially on the subway. It's a great system and easy to get all around the city on my own. I've been working a lot on Clipper City, sometimes as long as 12 hour shifts. On the weekends, there is a late sail in the evening so sometimes I get home close to 1 in the morning. I'm really enjoying the work and it's great seeing the big city and all the lights out on the water at night. Really cool! The rest of the time when I'm not out on the boat, we've been working on the documentary. It's getting colder really fast here but time is flying by. Next week, I'm visiting Tania Aebi in Vermont. Tania sailed around the world from 1985 to 1987 by a really similar route to what I did. When she started, she was 18 and had almost no sailing experience at all but she just went for it. I read her book Maiden Voyage ('Solo' in Dutch) for the first time when I was eight and got really inspired. She is one of the sailors I really admire and respect, so it will be exciting to finally meet.

My time in Whangarei has been really busy so far. The first couple days, media and people kept walking up the dock to Guppy, which didn't bother me at all because they were all so very nice. So yeah, that kept me busy for a while. And a lot of other great things have been happening too. I got my learner driver license which is pretty cool. I passed the written test so I can drive with someone else in the car until I get the full license. It's so exciting! Even after steering Guppy all around the world, it feels really awesome to be able to drive a car :). I also found work on a dive boat in Tutukaka! So I can start saving up money for another future adventure. There's still so much of the world left to see. While I work there, I want to get my commercial captain's license. So I've got plans to keep me busy for a while. I've also been down in Auckland for a TV show. They got me a flight from Whangarei. It was really amazing to fly over this beautiful country, to see green hills and blue water, here and there a house and a river with boats--it was all so beautiful! I couldn't stop staring out the window thinking wow, I live here now! Auckland is as big and busy as I imagined, but quite a nice city as far as I can say from the two hours I was down there, as I spent most of the time in the studio. It's still quite cold here, especially at night. One time it got down to 2 degrees! The people from the marina were so nice to give us a little electric heater and we got some more blankets so it's pretty cozy inside. And spring is coming. At day, when the sun comes out it's really nice and you can walk in just a t-shirt. We have such a great spot here in the marina, and there is even a sea lion who hangs around us all the time which is quite amazing. I am really in love with this beautiful country and all its friendly people.

I have really been enjoying the past few days in Whangarei. I've mainly been busy sorting out things like getting my driver's license and doing media requests. All the people have been so nice to me since I arrived, helping me out with many things, even though most of it I have to do myself anyway of course. Reva's, a restaurant just down in the Town Basin Marina invited us over for pizza the other night and it was lovely. She has had the restaurant for a lot of years now, and my parents used to eat there! I've also met quite a few of my parents' friends who still live down here and even my mom's midwife who helped deliver me to the world. They all remember me very well. Of course, I don't remember them, just from pictures and stories, but it's still really nice because it make me feel even more connected with this lovely part of the world. Bruno has been out skating pretty much all of the time since there's a park right across the river. He has already made some nice friends and found work. So, yeah, we are slowly rolling back into normal life. It's definitely different from traveling and sailing all the time, but taking a bit of a break from big passages for a while and doing some other things feels quite nice too.

Yesterday as I came in there was a boat with cameras aboard filming my entrance into Whangarei and then some media, all really nice people. As soon as we cleared in, I decided to go directly to the marina. I am happy we did that because it's pouring now! All the buoys were lit up along the way so it was quite easy. Immediately, we met some really nice people who took us for dinner, which was very cool of them. Then I just fell asleep right away and didn't wake up until the next morning. How lovely! As soon as we woke up, we went to the supermarket in the pouring rain and bought some fresh cheese and ham and bread for a nice breakfast! Yay! Oh and we got an umbrella too -.-. Then we finally had a nice hot shower and met the people at the Marina who are awesome. And then guess what?! Remember the boat Winddancer, that I met in South Africa and then had contact with in the Atlantic? Well, they left the boat in Curacao and they are here in Whangarei now (they have a house here) and we are going to have dinner with them tonight. Nice, hey?! I already love it here. And well, it finally stopped raining so we're going to go check this place out some more! Guppy smiles at me, so very happy to be here at her new home with her log stopping count, for the moment, at almost 36,000 nm. New Zealand, here we are!

Yesterday was another interesting day, sailing close hauled at 25-30 knots of wind, I heard a loud flapping in the afternoon. The top of Guppy's mainsail ripped off! So well yeah...it was way too rough to change the sail at that moment. But Guppy was under the mizzen and the stormjib still doing more than 6 knots, so it was okay. Today the wind dropped down a little and I was able to change the main this morning. The next depression is closing in on us fast but I hope to be in Whangarei entrance at 17.00 local. I checked the weathernet and they said that it would be really good if I could make it before 19.00 local time. Until then, the wind will be staying under 30 knots and the waves will probable be fine to make it in. I know Gup can do it =D. Everything is going well. We're doing a good 7.5 knots now with a temperature of 14 degrees during the day. So that's taking a bit of getting used to. Oh and we saw albatrosses today. That was kinda cool :).

Laura

It was a pretty rough night. The winds turned around to west south west, blowing at about 25 knots. We are beating against waves and wind so our speed dropped a little :(. We're now doing 5 knots with a reefed main and jib. So, yeah, Guppy is going through some messy seas right now but there are no more rocks at least, so that's good. It doesn't look like the rocks scratched Guppy too badly from what I can see now. I noticed on the weather chart a new front developing north of New Zealand. It won't be possible to totally outrun it but, ah well, I guess we will see. So everything is normal again. I got some cold massive waves over me while reefing down and getting the boom off the genoa :-P. And Guppy crossed the International Date Line again, her second time passing 24 hours into the future in one moment ;). Only three more days to Whangarei. Yay, exciting!

Laura

We had a pretty slow night, only doing 100 miles in the last 24 hours. The depression seems to be slowly falling apart so it looks like we wont be dealing with much of it at all. Last night I heard an enormous sound like it was pouring rain or something, so I ran outside and discovered we were sailing through a huge field of floating rocks, ranging from really small to football-size! So of course for most of the night I was outside staring at this strange phenomenon. I'd never seen floating rocks like this before. They are really light! I fished a few out of the water and stared at them for about an hour in total amazement. Now Guppy is on the move again doing 6 knots in a good 15 to 20 knot north wind that is slowly turning west. There are no floating rocks around anymore but I kept a few onboard to hold on to the memory of this strange experience. The wind is still picking up, the waves keep getting bigger, and it's almost starting to look like the northern hemisphere--cold, grey, and windy. Who says sailing is boring...

Laura
At the moment, we are doing a good 7 knots and the clouds have taken their darkness elsewhere, leaving us with a beautiful blue sky and a warm sun :). It's a perfect 18 degree day. And Guppy is getting great winds. Just 790 miles to go! The Kermadec Islands lie about 240 miles in front of us. I am making sure I stay away from them, as I don't want to be too close when the SW depression comes up. So yeah, we are moving along pretty well and I hope I can run out the depression a bit. I checked the weathernet from New Zealand today, and it looks like if we keep it moving, we may be able to escape the worst of it. But the wind is supposed to drop down before the depression, so I guess we will see. At least for now we are moving pretty well. And it's still fantastic out here.

Laura
Yesterday I thought we were going to have good winds and then it dropped back down entirely, so I ran the engine for a few hours. After the variable weather, I finally got some better southeast winds coming this morning. Tranquility is pretty close to us now, since they've been running the engine the whole time. So they've caught up again, although we haven't seen them yet. Earlier I heard Tomboy on the SSB radio net and tried to make contact with them. They're friends I met last year in Bora Bora who are in New Zealand now. I didn't have any luck, so will try again tomorrow. We're now about 200 nm from Tonga and headed straight to Whangarei, so about 1070 miles to go. New Zealand, here we come! Guppy is doing a nice 6 knots again and life is still comfortable.

Laura

Winds have been pretty variable yesterday and today. One moment we'll be doing 5 knots and then other moments just 2 knots. Over the last few hours, it looks like the wind has picked up to stay, and on a close reach we're sailing in the right direction again :p. Tranquility is still a little behind us in the same weather, but they are still motoring. They say a heavy boat like that doesn't want to move with anything less than 15 knots... We had a pretty good night sleep followed by a cold, cloudy morning. Looking at the weather report for the coming days, it appears Guppy will have good southeast winds and I will slowly start to head south. We are now a little over halfway and I am more and more looking forward to steering Guppy into my birthplace of Whangarei.
