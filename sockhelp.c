/* This function listens on a port, and returns connections.  It forks
   returns off internally, so your main function doesn't have to worry
   about that.  This can be confusing if you don't know what is going on.
   The function will create a new process for every incoming connection,
   so in the listening process, it will never return.  Only when a connection
   comes in, and we create a new process for it will the function return.
   This means that your code that calls it should _not_ loop.

   The parameters are as follows:
     socket_type: SOCK_STREAM or SOCK_DGRAM (TCP or UDP sockets)
     port: The port to listen on.  Remember that ports < 1024 are
       reserved for the root user.  Must be passed in network byte
       order (see "man htons").
     listener: This is a pointer to a variable for holding the file
       descriptor of the socket which is being used to listen.  It
       is provided so that you can write a signal handler to close
       it in the event of program termination.  If you aren't interested,
       just pass NULL.  Note that all modern unixes will close file
       descriptors for you on exit, so this is not required. */
